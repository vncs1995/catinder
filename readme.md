# Setup and run
I used react native init, so you can follow the official documentation to run it [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)


# About the packages installed

## axios
Used for handling api calls
I always like to use it with [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), I didn't use it to save time

## react-native-vector-icons
Used for the bottom tabs navigation

## react-native-swipe-cards-deck
I would definetly use PanResponder with reanimated library to handle this, but I need to save time

## react-native-svg
## react-native-svg-transformer
For using the gradient tinder icon

## Navigation dependencies
- @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
- react-native-screens 
- react-native-safe-area-context
- @react-navigation/native
